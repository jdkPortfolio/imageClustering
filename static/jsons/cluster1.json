But this six-part Netflix production does unfold at a languid, almost-hypnotic pace, while employing AI technology to create Warhol's voice reading his words from the great beyond, which is as oddly creepy as that sounds.","279":"Season 4 of the Amazon series picks up with the stand-up comic, two years after a strong Season 3. Mrs. Maisel is back on the road and in the spotlight.","280":"The parallels between \"The Gilded Age\" and Julian Fellowes' earlier creation \"Downton Abbey\" aren't hard to spot, which doesn't make this HBO drama any less delicious. Set in the moneyed corridors of New York during the 1880s, Fellowes and his sprawling cast have delivered another sharp look at wealth and class in earlier times, when even those with the gold chafed against the intricate rules.","281":"It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and \"Joe vs Carole\" feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's \"Tiger King,\" a.k.a.

","282":"Once you get past the astonishing makeup and prosthetics, \"Pam & Tommy\" essentially functions as two miniseries in one, the first devoted to the central couple, and the latter to the hapless guy who turned them into a pioneering Internet sensation. The former works better, in a limited series that sprinkles social insight (if not quite enough) in with its salacious qualities and breezy nostalgia.","283":"Best known for \"Friday Night Lights,\" producer Jason Katims has crafted another small coming-of-age gem with \"As We See It,\" adapting an Israeli series about a trio of 20-somethings on the autism spectrum, trying to find purpose and independence.
